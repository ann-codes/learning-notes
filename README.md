# Weekly Learning Notes
Are you like me and you learning how to code? When one is stuck in the weeds of the day-to-day, we can lose sight of how far we've come from our very first line of code and only think about our current difficulties. 

I created this page to track my progress, the time spent on coding/learning to code, and wins and struggles along the way. This is done in tandem with going through the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/AnnCodes). Check out the old [autodidact](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/) progress before I joined the [LaunchAcademy Bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/) through the [Apprenti Program](https://apprenticareers.org/) in Boston. 

## Weekly Progress Notes
*The goal is to dedicate at least 15 hours each week outside of bootcamp or work time as denoted by ^ when it is a good week.  Weeks are defined as Monday through Sunday and is ordered by most recent. Time is tracked with [Toggle](https://toggl.com/) (best app ever!).*

**WEEK 35: 12/30/2019 - 01/05/2020: XXhrs XXmins**
-   Since I am enrolling into a [bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/), I guess posting to the [autodidact](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/) will no longer completely true. I've created a new [learning notes](https://ann-codes.github.io/learning-notes/) repo in the same format so that I can track my time during the bootcamp/work and any independant projects. 
-   I also ["restarted"](https://twitter.com/AnnCodes/status/1212537570019725313) a new round of #100DaysOfCode as of 1/1/20. Given the breaks from the last 3 weeks, it felt silly to have that big of a gap while continuing the 100 days. I am officially ending it at **245 Consecutive Days** even though it was probaly something like 257 consecutive days if you actually count watching CS videos in bed for 10 mins or so before passing out from exhaustion. 
-   This week is all up about catching up to and finishing the LaunchAcademy precourse work. 

**FROM THE BEGINNING**
-   Check out the old [autodidact](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/) progress updates before I joined the [LaunchAcademy Bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/) through the [Apprenti Program](https://apprenticareers.org/) in Boston. I changed the name because it autodidact is no longer 100% correct.
