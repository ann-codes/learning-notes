# Weekly Learning Notes
Are you like me and you learning how to code? When one is stuck in the weeds of the day-to-day, we can lose sight of how far we've come from our very first line of code and only think about our current difficulties. 

I created this page to track my progress, the time spent on coding/learning to code, and wins and struggles along the way. This is done in tandem with going through the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/AnnCodes). Check out the old [autodidact](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/) progress before I joined the [LaunchAcademy Bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/) through the [Apprenti Program](https://apprenticareers.org/) in Boston. 

## Weekly Progress Notes
*The goal is to dedicate at least 7 hours each week (1 hour/day) outside of bootcamp or work time as denoted by ^ when it is a good week.  Weeks are defined as Monday through Sunday and is ordered by most recent. Time is tracked with [Toggle](https://toggl.com/) (best app ever!).*

**WEEK 36: 01/06/2020 - 01/12/2020: XXhrs XXmins**
-   The [Launch Academy bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/) for the [Apprenti Program](https://apprenticareers.org/) is an 19 week in-person bootcamp in Boston. We will go through topics pretty quickly each week. Around week 8 or 9 there will be a small group project. Weeks 18-19 will be a larger group project. 
-   They do sort of a backwards mode of instruction where the new concepts are introduced as part of the homework (reading and assignments). In the mornings, we go through the homework material, then have another lecture building on that. At noon, we break for lunch at which time the afternoon assignments are posted where we work on after lunch to the late afternoon. The last lecture commences further building on the material, and then homework assignments are released for the day and we can go home or work on the homework assignments. Then rinse and repeat. On Fridays, we have a test of sorts where we are tested on the material from the week. Students are expected to pass at least half the tests each week in order to graduate. 
-   Topics for the bootcamp was going through basics such as the command line, data types, variables, functions, scope, loops. 
-   So far, I am a fan of the process because it is varied enough in terms of the type of work to do so you are not slogging through the same old thing every day. 
-   I am very happy that I self learned for so long and understand these basics. I feel like it would have been incredibly hard for me to go into a bootcamp without it. For anyone thinking of doing a bootcamp, it will be incredibly hard to go into one from zero. Having the foundation really does help you learn so much better as well! Additionally, since the assignements are basically coding drills similarly to Edabit or Codewars (which I love!), that I did not have any issues with acclimating to the process at all. 

**WEEK 35: 12/30/2019 - 01/05/2020: 4hrs 8mins**
-   Since I am enrolling into a [bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/), I guess posting to the [autodidact](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/) will no longer be completely true. I've created a new [learning notes](https://ann-codes.github.io/learning-notes/) repo in the same format so that I can track my time during the bootcamp/work and any independant projects. 
-   I also ["restarted"](https://twitter.com/AnnCodes/status/1212537570019725313) a new round of #100DaysOfCode as of 1/1/20. Given the breaks from the last 3 weeks, it felt silly to have that big of a gap while continuing the 100 days. I am officially ending it at **245 Consecutive Days** even though it was probaly something like 257 consecutive days if you actually count watching CS videos in bed for 10 mins or so before passing out from exhaustion. 
-   I skipped days 12/30-12/31 since I was flying back and then jetlagged those days. 
-   This week is all up about catching up to and finishing the LaunchAcademy precourse work and getting ready for next week!

**FROM THE BEGINNING**
-   Check out the old [autodidact](https://ann-codes.github.io/autodidact/) progress updates before I joined the [LaunchAcademy Bootcamp](https://launchacademy.com/) through the [Apprenti Program](https://apprenticareers.org/) in Boston. I changed the name because it autodidact is no longer 100% correct.
